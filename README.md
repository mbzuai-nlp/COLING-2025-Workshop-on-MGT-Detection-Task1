Large language models (LLMs) are becoming mainstream and easily accessible, ushering in an explosion of machine-generated content over various channels, such as news, social media, question-answering forums, educational, and even academic contexts. Recent LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, generate remarkably fluent responses to a wide variety of user queries. The articulate nature of such generated texts makes LLMs attractive for replacing human labor in many scenarios. However, this has also resulted in concerns regarding their potential misuse, such as spreading misinformation and causing disruptions in the education system. Since humans perform only slightly better than chance when classifying machine-generated vs. human-written text, there is a need to develop automatic systems to identify machine-generated text with the goal of mitigating its potential misuse. 

In the Task 1, we adopt a straightforward binary problem formulation from the previous work of determining whether a given text is generated by a machine or authored by a human. This is the continuation and improvement of the [SemEval Shared Task 8 (subtask A)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14183). We aim to refresh training and testing data with generations from novel LLMs and include new languages.

### Prediction File Format and Format Checkers

A prediction file must be one single JSONL file for all texts. The entry for each text must include the fields "id" and "label".  

The format checkers verify that your prediction file complies with the expected format. They are located in the ```format_checker``` module.

```python
python3 format_checker.py --prediction_file_path=<path_to_your_results_files> 
```

Note that format checkers can not verify whether the prediction file you submit contains predictions for all test instances because it does not have an access to the test file.

## <a name="scorer_and_official_evaluation_metrics"></a>Scorer and Official Evaluation Metrics

The scorers for the subtasks are located in the ```scorer``` modules.
The scorer will report the official evaluation metric and other metrics for a given prediction file.

The **official evaluation metric** is **macro f1-score**. However, the scorer also reports accuracy and micro-F1. 

The following command runs the scorer:
```python
python3 scorer.py --gold_file_path=<path_to_gold_labels> --prediction_file_path=<path_to_your_results_file> 
```

## <a name="baselines"></a>Baselines

Running the Transformer baseline:
 ```
python3 baseline.py --train_file_path <path_to_train_file> --dev_file_path <path_to_development_file> --test_file_path <path_to_test_file> --prediction_file_path <path_to_save_predictions> --model <path_to_model>
 ```

The result for the English setup for RoBERTa is 81.63;

The result for the multilingual setup for XLM-R is 65.46;
